# Describing Variation

```{r include = FALSE}
library(mosaic)
require(mosaicData)
```


As a setting to illustrate computer techniques for describing variability, take the data that Galton collected on the heights of adult children and their parents. These data, in a modern case/variable format, are made available as `Galton` when the `mosaic` package is used.

```{r}
require(mosaic)
Galton = read.csv("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/galton.csv")
# As it happens, Galton is already loaded by mosaic from the mosaicData package. 
# So you don't need the read.csv(); we use it here for the sake of generality.
```

## Simple Statistical Calculations

Simple numerical descriptions are easy to compute.  Here are the mean,
median, standard deviation and variance of the children's heights (in
inches).


```{r}
# [Always a space on both sides of an operator]
mean( ~ height, data = Galton)
median( ~ height, data = Galton)
sd( ~ height, data = Galton)
var( ~ height, data = Galton)
```

Notice that the variance function `var()` returns the square of the standard deviation produced by `sd()`. Having both is merely a convenience.

Why the tilde?  In all these commands the first argument (` ~ height`) is recognized by the interpreter as a model formula.  Model language involves the tilde, and the tilde must be followed by a variable.

### Aside: The "base" versions

> The built-in, base R version of commands such as `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, and so on (that is, in their default non-`mosaic` form) take numeric vectors (columns of numbers) as arguments, but then the convenience of the `data = ` designation is not available. For instance:
    
```{r}
mean(Galton$height)
median(Galton$height)
```

As we have seen before, R's model language also allows more sophisticated model arguments, as in

```{r}
median(height ~ sex, data = Galton)
```



A percentile tells where a given value falls in a distribution.  For example, a height of 63 inches is on the short side in Galton's data:
```{r}
pdata( ~ height, 63, data = Galton)
```
Only about 19 \% of the cases have a height less than or equal to 63 inches.  The `pdata` operator takes one or more values as a second argument (here, 63) and finds where they fall in the distribution of values in the first argument (`height`).


A quantile refers to the same sort of calculation, but inverted.  Instead of giving a value in the same units as the distribution, you give a probability: a number between 0 and 1.  The `qdata` operator then calculates the value whose percentile would be that value.  What's the 20th percentile of Galton's heights?
```{r}
qdata( ~ height, 0.2, data = Galton)
```
Remember that the probability is given as a number between 0 and 1, so use 0.50 to indicate that you want the value which falls at the 50th percentile.

```{r}
qdata( ~ height, 0.5, data = Galton)
median( ~ height, data = Galton)
```


<!-- begin itemize -->

#. The 25th and 75th percentile in a single command --- in other words, the 50 percent coverage interval:
```{r}
# [Note: formula should be first argument.]
qdata( ~ height, c(0.25, 0.75), data = Galton)
```

#. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentile --- in other words, the 95 percent coverage interval:
```{r}
qdata( ~ height, c(0.025, 0.975), data = Galton)
```
<!-- end itemize -->

The interquartile range is the width of the 50 percent coverage
interval:
```{r}
IQR( ~ height, data = Galton)
```

Some other useful operators are `min()`, `max()`, and
`range()`.  


## Simple Statistical Graphics

There are several basic types of statistical graphics to display
the distribution of a variable: histograms, density plots, and
boxplots.  These are easily mastered by example. 

### Histograms and Distributions


Constructing a histogram involves dividing the range of a variable up
into bins and counting how many cases fall into each bin.  This is
done in an almost entirely automatic way:
```{r}
histogram( ~ height, data = Galton)
```

When constructing a histogram, R makes an automatic but sensible
choice of the number of bins.  If you like, you can control this
yourself.  For instance:

```{r}
histogram( ~ height, data = Galton, breaks = 25 )
```

The  horizontal axis of the histogram is always in the units of the variable.
For the histograms above, the  horizontal axis is in "inches" because that
is the unit of the `height` variable. 

The vertical axis is conventionally drawn in one of three ways:
controlled by an optional argument named `type`.
<!-- begin description -->

#. **Absolute Frequency or Counts**  

A simple count of the number of cases that
  falls into each bin.  This mode is set with
  `type="count"` as in 
```{r}
histogram( ~ height, data = Galton, type = "count")
```
 Figures/variation-var3-hist 

#. **Relative Frequency** 

The vertical axis is scaled so that the 
height of the bar give the proportion of cases that fall into the
bin.  This is the default, that is, this is the `type` if you don't specify `type` in the command.

#. **Density** 

The vertical axis 
*area* of the bar gives the relative proportion of cases that fall
into the bin.  Set `type = "density"`.
<!-- end description -->
In a density plot, areas can be interpreted as probabilities and the
area under the entire histogram is equal to 1.

Other useful optional arguments set the labels for the axes and the
graph as a whole and color the bars.  For example,
```{r}
histogram( ~ height, data = Galton, type = "density",
     xlab="Height (inches)", 
     main="Distribution of Heights",
     col="gray")
```

The above command is so long that it has been broken into several
lines for display purposes.  R ignores the line breaks, holding off on
executing the command until it sees the final closing parentheses.
Notice the use of quotation marks to delimit the labels and names like
`"blue"`.  Also note the `+` signs that appear in place of the prompt (`>`) on new lines when the command is still incomplete.  If a plus sign appears when you are expecting a prompt, R is telling you that the previous command is incomplete.  You need to complete it before you get back to the prompt.

### Density Plots


A density plot avoids the need to create bins and plots out
the distribution as a continuous curve.  Making a density plot
involves two operators.  The density operator performs the
basic computation which is then displayed using either the `plot`
or the `lines` operator.  For example:
```{r}
densityplot( ~ height, data = Galton) 
```

If you want to suppress the rug-like plotting of points at the bottom
of the graph, use `densityplot( ~ height, data = Galton, plot.points = FALSE)`.


### Box-and-Whisker Plots

Box-and-whisker plots are made with the `bwplot` command:
```{r}
bwplot( ~ height, data = Galton)
```

The median is represented by the heavy dot in the middle.  Outliers,
if any, are marked by dots outside the whiskers.


The real power of the box-and-whisker plot is for comparing
distributions.  This will be raised again more systematically in later
chapters, but just to illustrate, here is how to compare the heights
of males and females:

```{r}
bwplot(height ~ sex, data = Galton)
```

## Displays of Categorical Variables



For categorical variables, it makes no sense to compute descriptive
statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, or variance.
Instead, look at the number of cases at each level of the variable.
```{r}
tally( ~ sex, data = Galton)
```
Proportions can be found by dividing the tallies by the total:

```{r}
tally( ~ sex, data = Galton)/nrow(Galton)
```

# Just a really cool graph
```{r}
install.packages("mapview")
install.packages("tidycensus")

require(mapview, tidycensus)

tidycensus::get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  state = "IA",
  geometry = TRUE
) |>
  mapview::mapview(
    zcol = "estimate",
    layer.name = "Median household income"
  )
```
