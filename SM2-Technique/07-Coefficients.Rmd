## Examining model coefficients 
 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'lm@lm')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Modeling!lm@lm')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'coefficients!computing best fitting')`
 
 
 
The `lm()` operator finds model coefficients. To illustrate,
here's a pair of statements that read in a data frame and fit a model
to it:
```{r}
mod <- lm( time ~ year + sex, data = SwimRecords) 
```
The first argument to `lm` is a model design, the second is the data frame.

`r detex_index_entry('P', 'coef@coef')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Modeling!coef@coef')` 

The object  created by `lm` --- here given the name `mod` --- contains a variety of
information about the model.
To access the coefficients themselves, use the `coef()`
operator applied to the model:
```{r}
coef(mod)
```

As shorthand to display the coefficients, just type the
name of the object that is storing the model:
```{r}
mod
```

`r detex_index_entry('P', 'summary@summary!for lm')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Modeling@regression report with summary')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Regression report with summary')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'regression report!computing')` 

A more detailed report can be gotten with the `summary`
operator. This gives additional statistical information
that will be used in later chapters:
```{r}
summary(mod)
```

`r detex_index_entry('C', 'model value!calculating')` 

From time to time in the exercises, you will be asked to calculate
model values "by hand."  This is accomplished by multiplying
the coefficients by the appropriate values and adding them up.  For
example, the model value for a male swimmer in 2010 would be:
```{r}
555.7 - 0.2515*2010 - 9.798
```

Notice that the "value" used to multiply the intercept is always 1,
and the "value" used for a categorical level is either 0 or 1
depending on whether there is a match with the level.  In this example,
since the swimmer in question was male, the value of `sex M` is 1.
If the swimmer had been female, the value for
`sex M` would have been 0.

When a model includes interaction terms, the interaction coefficients
need to be multiplied by all the values involved in the interaction.
For example, here is a model with an interaction between `year` and
`sex`:

`r detex_index_entry('C', 'interaction term!computing model values')` 
```{r}
mod2 <- lm( time ~ year * sex, data = SwimRecords)
coef(mod2)
```
```{r}
697.3 - 0.3240*2010 - 302.5 + 0.1499*2010
```

The `year:sexM` coefficient is being multiplied by the year
(2010) and the value of `sex M`, which is 1 for this
male swimmer.

## Other Useful Operators

`r detex_index_entry('P', 'cross@cross*')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Data!cross@cross*')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'crossing categorical variables')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'categorical variable!crossing')` 
1. `cross()` will combine two categorical variables into a single
  variable.  For example, in the Current Population Survey data, the
  variable `sex` has levels F and M, while the variable `race`
  has levels W and NW.  Crossing the two variables combines them; the
  new variable has four levels: F.NW, M.NW, F.W, M.W:
  
```{r}
CPS <- CPS85  # from mosaicData
RaceSex <- cross(CPS$sex, CPS$race)
summary(RaceSex)
```

The summary tells us that there are 28 non-white females, 270 white females, etc, in the new categorical variable called RaceSex.

`r detex_index_entry('P', 'as.factor@as.factor')` 
`r detex_index_entry('P', 'Data!as.factor@as.factor')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'categorical variable!from quantitative')` 
`r detex_index_entry('C', 'quantitative variable!to categorical')` 

2. `as.factor()` will convert a quantitative variable to a categorical
  variable.  This is useful when a quantity like `month` has been
  coded as a number, say 1 for January and 2 for February, etc.
  but you do not want models to treat it as such.

  To illustrate, consider two different models of the usage
  temperature versus month:
```{r}
utils <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/utilities.csv")
mod1 <- lm( temp ~ month, data = utils)
mod2 <- lm( temp ~ as.factor(month), data = utils)
```

Here are the graphs of those models:

```{r}
xyplot(temp + fitted(mod1) ~ month, data = utils)
```


```{r}
xyplot( temp + fitted(mod2) ~ month, data = utils )
```

<!-- 

utils <- read.csv("/users/kaplan/kaplanfiles/sbook/datasets/utilities.csv")
mod1 <- lm( temp ~ month, data = utils)
xyplot( temp ~ month, data = utils, main = "Model 1")
trellis.focus()
x <- seq(1,12)
y <- 39.04 + 1.63*x
llines(x,y,col = 'red',lwd = 3)
trellis.unfocus()

mod2 <- lm( temp ~ as.factor(month)-1, data = utils)
x <- 1:12
y <- as.numeric( coefficients(mod2))
xyplot( temp ~ month, data = utils, main = "Model 2")
trellis.focus()
llines(  x,y, lwd = 3, col = 'red')
trellis.unfocus()
end comment -->

In the first model, month is treated quantitatively, so the model term
`month` produces a straight-line relationship that does not
correspond well to the data.

In the second model, month is treated categorically, allowing a more
complicated model relationship.  In fact, this is a groupwise model: the model values represent the mean temperature for each month.
